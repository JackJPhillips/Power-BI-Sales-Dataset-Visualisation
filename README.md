# Power BI Sales Dataset Visualisation

## Exploring the Data:
Use the Data view to inspect columns across two different tables, those being OrderBreakdown and ListOfOrders. Under the view ribbon I selected column quality, column distribution and column profile in order to quickly scan the data. (Duplicate data, N/A values, Min/Max and Average of columns.

### Aesthetic addons:
Its possible to add cards to a dashboard to easily and boldly show key takeaways from the data, here are three added to mine:

### Filtering:
One of the benefits of these visualisations is that they are all interconnected, any piece of data can be selected on the dashboard and all other charts will filter accordingly.

As shown if I select the United Kingdom on the Profit by Country:

We can see all the data just regarding this region.

Lets say an investor wants to see everything related to a specific shipping method, we can select it from the Delivery Options Chart:
